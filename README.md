# Azuria: CORE
1.18.2 mod - Economy, Territory &amp; Power
Copyright (C) 2022[^1] - [@KalenNamiryu]

Huge thanks to [@Kaupenjoe] for his [modding tutorial] that helped me a lot for my first mod! Several parts of my mod comes directly from his tutorial.


## CORE
I started this mod by thinking "what would be an ideal server basic mod".

Some kind of basic thing like a **better economy**, an **advanced claims management** or a way to **gain power** by just doing your normal survival stuffs.  
Why should money just appear without any limits ?  
Why can't I unlock more territories while becomming more powerfull ?  
And why the hell didn't I got more strengh than that while mining so much stuffs ??  

Well if you also ask yourself these kinds of questions, feel free to take a look !
