<ins>Current version of the mod:</ins> ***0.0.3-1.18.2***

Huge thanks to [@Kaupenjoe] for his [modding tutorial] that helped me a lot for my first mod!  
Several parts of my mod comes directly from his tutorial.


## CORE
I started this mod by thinking "what would be an ideal server basic mod".

Some kind of basic thing like a **better economy**, an **advanced claims management** or a way to **gain power** by just doing your normal survival stuffs.  
Why should money just appear without any limits ?  
Why can't I unlock more territories while becomming more powerfull ?  
And why the hell didn't I got more strengh than that while mining so much stuffs ??  

Well if you also ask yourself these kinds of questions, feel free to take a look !
