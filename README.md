Huge thanks to [@Kaupenjoe] for his [modding tutorial] that helped me a lot for my first mod!  
Several parts of my mod comes directly from his tutorial.


## CORE
I started this mod by thinking "what would be an ideal server basic mod".

Some things like a ***valuable economy***, an ***advanced claims management*** or a way to ***gain power*** by your actions.  
- Why should money just appear without any limits ?  
- Why can't I unlock more territories while becomming more powerfull ?  
- And why the hell didn't I got more strengh than that while mining so much stuffs ??  

Well if you also ask yourself these kinds of questions, feel free to take a look !
